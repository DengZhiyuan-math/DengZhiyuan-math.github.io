I am a Ph.D student advised by [Prof. Gorodnik](https://www.math.uzh.ch/gorodnik/) from [University of Zurich](https://www.math.uzh.ch/home) as part of [dynamical system and ergodic theory group](https://www2.math.ethz.ch/dynamics/about). My research interest lies in the interface of dynamical system and number theory.
